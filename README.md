# SimpleArgParser

SimpleArgParser is a minimalistic command-line argument parser for C++, inspired by other similar libraries, mainly the Python argparse module. Although there are a lot of similiar libraries this one focus on being over-simplified, by limiting the functionalities to the bare minimum necessary for it to work. The main features of it are:

* Include-Only: meaning that no linking is needed
* Object-oriented: so people can customize the parser in sub-classes
* Simplified interface: the reduced number of functions fits very well in the user brain cache! ;)

Please note that this is a very simple library, so if you need a more robust library with more tools and option this may not be for you. If that's the case there are other libraries that are also simple but more robust than SimpleArgParser.

## Usability ( in progress :p )
